# inkyphat
A notification system built for the inkyphat raspberry pi screen


These are several small scripts I've put together to display information on the [InkyPhat Raspberry Pi Screen](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/inky-phat). 
One gathers the top stories on Hacker News for the day, and the other simply fetches the weather. They are both simple Python scripts which are run by cron 
jobs to update the display every half an hour. The pi itself is easy to SSH into from so settings can be updated quickly and easily.
